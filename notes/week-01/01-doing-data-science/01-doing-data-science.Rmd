### What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights 
from structured and unstructured data. It involves combining knowledge and 
techniques from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze and understand complex phenomena and solve problems.

Data Science encompasses a wide range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, integration, analysis, modeling, and visualization, as well as the communication of findings and insights to stakeholders. It involves the use of various tools, techniques, and technologies, including statistical software, 
machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and big data platforms.

Data Science has numerous applications across industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, social media, and many others. The insights and predictions derived from data analysis can be used to drive business decisions, inform 
policy, and improve the lives of individuals and communities.


### How to do Data Science?

The first step almost always is to __import__ data. Data comes in different
forms and shapes: files, databases, APIs etc. Before you can start analyzing
data, you need to bring it into the environment you are working with.

Raw data is almost always NEVER clean. Hence, the next step in a typical
data science workflow is to __tidy__ it. Tidying data often involves cleaning


Now that you have clean data, the third step is to __transform__ it. In this
step, you often manipulate individual variables, add new variables, select
observations of interest, aggregate values across specific groups etc.

The real fun starts after you have transformed your data

### Why R & Tidyverse?

<!-- Why R? -->


One of the biggest strengths of R is its extensive ecosystem of __packages__.
An R package is a suite of functions along with data and documentation, that
extends the functionality of base R. 

<!-- Why Tidyverse -->

The Tidyverse is a highly opinionated set of packages that share a common
underlying grammar and philosophy and are designed to work together to execute
the data science workflow.
