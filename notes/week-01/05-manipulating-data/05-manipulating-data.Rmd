## Manipulating Data


```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>")
set.seed(1234)
```


Recall how data manipulation operations work on rows and columns of a table, while leaving its shape largely intact. It is useful to group these operations based on whether they manipulate rows or columns.

We will use a handy dataset named `starwars` that ships with the `dplyr` package, to illustrate the basic idea behind these data manipulation operations. While the data is largely self explanatory, as always, you can type `? starwars` to get more details on the data.

```{r}
starwars
```


### Manipulating Rows

These functions operate on the rows of a table and allow us to subset a table based on 

#### `filter`: Keep rows that match a condition

The `filter()` functions allows you to subset rows of a table based on a set of one or more matching conditions. You can combine one or more criteria to keep only the rows that you want to keep.

Run these examples one at a time to understand what they accomplish. In order to get the most out of it, have a hypothesis in place before you run the line of code, so you can corroborate your understanding with the results. Finally, don't limit yourself to these examples. Come up with your own criteria and explore.


```{r}
# One criterion, One expression
filter(starwars, species == "Human")
filter(starwars, mass > 1000)

# Multiple criterion, One expression
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none" | eye_color == "black")

# Multiple criterion, Multiple expressions
filter(starwars, hair_color == "none", eye_color == "black")
```

#### `arrange`: Order rows using column values

The `arrange()` function lets you sort a table based on the values of one or more columns. You can use the modifier function, `desc()`, to indicate that you want to sort a column in the descending order.

```{r}
# Single Column > Ascending
arrange(starwars, name)
arrange(starwars, mass)

# Single Column > Descending
arrange(starwars, desc(mass))

# Multiple Columns
arrange(starwars, name, desc(mass))
```

#### `distinct`: Keep distinct/unique rows

The `distinct()` function allows you to keep rows with distinct combinations of column values.

```{r}
# Single Column
distinct(starwars, sex)

# Multiple Columns
distinct(starwars, sex, skin_color)
```

#### `slice`: Subset rows using their positions

The `slice_` family of functions let you subset rows based on their position. It ships with several variations that let you pick rows by their absolute position (`slice_head` and `slice_tail`), by their relative position based on a column value (`slice_min` and `slice_max`), or at random (`slice_sample`).

```{r}
# Rows 1-5
slice(starwars, 1:5)

# First 5 Rows
slice_head(starwars, n = 5)

# Last 5 Rows
slice_tail(starwars, n = 5)

# First 5 Rows arranged by height
slice_min(starwars, height, n = 5)

# First 5 Rows arranged by descending height
slice_max(starwars, height, n = 5)

# Random 5 Rows
slice_sample(starwars, n = 5)

# Random 20% Rows
slice_sample(starwars, prop = 0.20)
```


### Manipulating Columns

#### `select`: Keep or drop columns (1 / 2)

The `select` function lets you keep or drop columns in a dataset. You can use unquoted column names, ranges, and even boolean operators to define your selection. 

```{r}
# Keep columns name and mass
select(starwars, name, mass)

# Keep columns from name to skin_color, and species
select(starwars, name:skin_color, species)

# Drop columns mass and height
select(starwars, -mass, -height)

# Drop columns from mass to skin_color
select(starwars, !(mass:skin_color))
```

#### `select`: Keep or drop columns (2 / 2)

The `dplyr` package also provides a handy set of selectors (`contains`, `ends_with`, `where` etc) that let you select columns based on a pattern. This is very handy especially when you want to pick multiple columns, but don't want to type each column name separately.

To get the most out of this, please run each example separately. Also, look up the examples in the package by typing `? dplyr::select` in your R console. These functions are the basic building blocks of data manipulation and provide you with a very wide toolkit. The more you are able to hold these in your muscle memory, the more adept you will become with data manipulation.

```{r}
# Keep columns containing the word "color"
select(starwars, contains("color"))

# Keep columns ending with the word "color"
select(starwars, ends_with("color"))

# Keep columns which are numeric
select(starwars, where(is.numeric))

# Keep columns which are lists
select(starwars, where(is.list))
```


#### `mutate`: Create, modify, and delete columns

The `mutate()` function can be used to create, modify, or remove columns.

```{r}
# Create column mass_lbs
mutate(starwars, mass_lbs = mass * 2.2)

# Modify column height
mutate(starwars, height = height * 0.0328084)

# Remove column: 
mutate(starwars, mass = NULL)

# Do it all at once
mutate(starwars, mass_lbs = mass * 2.2, mass = NULL)
```

#### `rename`: Rename columns

The `rename()` function can be used to rename one or more columns. It can
be combined with the selector functions like `ends_with()` to operate on
multiple columns based on patterns.

```{r}
# Rename
rename(starwars, mass_kgs = mass)

# Rename ALL columns to uppercase
rename_with(starwars, toupper)

# Rename “color” columns to uppercase
rename_with(starwars, toupper, ends_with("color"))
```

#### `relocate`: Relocate columns

The `relocate()` function can be used to relocate a column before or
after another column in the table.

```{r}
# Relocate column AFTER a column
relocate(starwars, sex, .after = name)

# Relocate a column BEFORE a column
relocate(starwars, sex, .before = mass)

# Relocate ALL character columns to the front
relocate(starwars, where(is.character))

# Relocate all NUMERIC columns AFTER all CHARACTER columns
relocate(starwars, where(is.numeric), .after = where(is.character))
```

#### `unite`: Unite multiple columns into one

The `unite()` function can be used to combine multiple columns into a single column. For example, we can combine the `mass` and `height` columns into a single new column.

```{r}
unite(starwars, height_mass, height, mass, sep = "_|_")
```


#### `separate`: Separate one column into multiple columns

The `separate()` function does the exact opposite of the `unite()` function and separates a single column into multiple columns based on a separator. Look at the help documents by typing `? separate` to get a comprehensive look at the various argumetns and use cases it supports.

```{r}
separate(starwars, name, c('first_name', 'last_name'), sep = "\\s")
```

In this lesson, you learnt the most fundamental verbs of data manipulation that let you operate on the rows and columns of a table, while keeping the underlying unit of observation the same. The full power of the `tidyverse` stems from the fact that you can combine these verbs together into a pipeline to achieve even the most complex data transformations.
